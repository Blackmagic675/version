# FiveM Scripts - Version Tracker

Public version information repository for my FiveM scripts. This repo is used for automatic update checking.

## 🔄 How Version Checking Works

My scripts automatically check this repository for version updates on server start.

When an update is available, server owners will see:
```
========================================
[ember-farming] UPDATE AVAILABLE!
Current: 1.0.0 → Latest: 1.0.1
Changelog: Fixed XP bug, added new features
========================================
```

## ⚠️ Note

This repository **only** contains version information. Script files are kept in private repositories and are not publicly available.
